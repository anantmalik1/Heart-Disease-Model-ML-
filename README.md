## 🧠 About The Project

This project is an **End-to-End Machine Learning Web Application** designed to predict the risk of heart disease based on medical parameters.

It uses a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification model and provides an interactive dashboard with:

- 🎯 Risk Percentage Gauge (Speedometer)
- 📊 3D Interactive Feature Visualization
- 🌗 Dark Mode Dashboard
- ⚡ Real-time Prediction
- 💡 Clean Medical UI
